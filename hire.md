### Designer / frontender for hire

Grew up in [Adform](https://adform.com) (3,5yrs), matured in [Vinted](https://vinted.com) (4,5yrs), had a couple of gigs in-between. During almost 11 years, had an opportunity to learn from great leaders such as [Alexey Kovalyov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksejkovaliov/), [Sergejus Barinovas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergejus/), [Andrius Baranauskas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriusbaranauskas/), [Mindaugas Mozuras](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mindaugasmozuras/), [Mykolas Dumcius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mykolasdumcius/) and others. These are the people, who shaped me as professional. For me this is a lot more important than nice pictures in any portfolio :)

Spent my whole career designing and coding frontend. I consider myself a designer, but happy to do both. Having these different skills helped me build broader perspective, understand team members better and achieve results faster. Led design and frontend guilds at Vinted at one point, helped new leaders later.

Looking for a company, where I can learn and help shape great products and teams. Ideally, remote (have experience with that), Vilnius (where I'm based now) works fine too. Will consider relocation. Especially if you have surf/snowboarding spot nearby or your city runs on bikes.
